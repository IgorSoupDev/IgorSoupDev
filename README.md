### Hi there! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on homebrews for old consoles.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning something new every day.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.

💻🎮 I absolutely love programming on retro consoles; I adore the challenges that each hardware can provide. It's amazing to explore the capabilities of these vintage systems and create something fresh and exciting. The feeling of crafting software that runs on classic gaming machines is truly special and brings a sense of nostalgia and joy! 🕹️🎉
